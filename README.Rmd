# gsod: Tools for using NOAA Global Surface Summary of the Day data

## Installation


```r
if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
install_github('databrew/gsod')
```


```{r setup, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      fig.width = 4,
                      fig.height = 4)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(gsod)
```

## Purpose

[GSOD data](https://data.noaa.gov/dataset/global-surface-summary-of-the-day-gsod), with daily meterological summaries of over 9,000 weather stations around the world, is large, stored in tens of thousands of different files, and a bit difficult to quickly access and use. The purpose of the `gsod` package is to make accessing and analyzing GSOD data quicker and easier. 

## Use 

The `gsod` package consists of 18 dataframes, one for each year from 2000 through 2017. To access any of these dataframes, simply attach the package and then type `gsod<year>`. For example:

```{r}
library(gsod)
my_data <- gsod2016
head(my_data)
```

## Examples

### Get conditions at every weather station on July 1, 2016.

```{r}
library(gsod)
library(tidyverse)
avg_temp <- 
  gsod2016 %>%
  filter(date == '2016-07-01') 
```

### Plot 

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 6}
library(rworldmap)
library(ggplot2)
world <- map_data(map="world")

ggplot() + 
  geom_map(data=world, 
           map=world,
           aes(map_id=region, x=long, y=lat),
           fill = 'black',
           alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_point(data = avg_temp,
             aes(x = lon,
                 y = lat,
                 color = visib),
             alpha = 0.6,
             size = 0.05) +
  scale_color_continuous(na.value = NA,
                         name = 'Visibility',
                         low = 'yellow',
                         high = 'blue') +
  labs(x = 'Longitude',
       y = 'Latitude') +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

## Why `gsod`?

The main advantage of using the `gsod` package over alternatives is speed: rather than interacting with NOAA's FTP server, using the `gsod` package means you have the data on your hard drive upon installation, and can get into an R session quickly. If you want more flexibility, need live up-to-date data, or want more control over the formatting, units, and uncertainty around these data, you should consult the README of the [GSODR package](https://github.com/ropensci/GSODR), which dives into more detail about the data source, and also gives an overview of available alternatives.

This package owes a debt of gratitude to the work carried out in the [GSODR package](https://github.com/ropensci/GSODR). Specifically, it relied heavily on the `GSODR::reformat_GSOD` function to "clean up" the data prior to storage.
